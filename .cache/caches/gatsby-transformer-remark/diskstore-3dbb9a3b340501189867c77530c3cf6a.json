Analyzed their performance on convergence rates, computational efficiency, and suitability for complex machine learning tasks. Results highlighted ADAHessian's ability to leverage curvature information for faster convergence in non-convex optimization problems. The study provided practical insights into choosing optimizers based on trade-offs between performance and computational cost.</p>"}
