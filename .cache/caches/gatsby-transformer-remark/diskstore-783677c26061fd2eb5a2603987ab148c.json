Analyzed their performance on convergence rates, computational efficiency, and suitability for complex machine learning tasks. Results highlighted ADAHessian's ability to leverage curvature information for faster convergence in non-convex optimization problems. The study provided practical insights into choosing optimizers based on trade-offs between performance and computational cost.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":508,"offset":508}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":508,"offset":508}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":2,"column":508,"offset":508}}}}
