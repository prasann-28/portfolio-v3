Developed a decentralized application (dApp) using Solidity, Ethereum, and React to enhance transparency in supply chain tracking, achieving a 40% improvement. Integrated Hyperledger and IPFS for immutable data storage, reducing manual verification efforts by 50%. Deployed the solution on a local blockchain network with Docker, providing a secure, tamper-proof system for industry use.
