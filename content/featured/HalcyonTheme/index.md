Conducted a survey comparing ADAHessian, a second-order optimizer, with popular first-order methods like SGD and Adam. Analyzed their performance on convergence rates, computational efficiency, and suitability for complex machine learning tasks. Results highlighted ADAHessian's ability to leverage curvature information for faster convergence in non-convex optimization problems.
